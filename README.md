## About
In this project we extract EPL match statistics over all seasons, perform descriptive analysis and express them
through vivid and elusive data visualization techniques.

We aim to visualize that which were the top teams in every given EPL season, where did a given
team stand as compared to others in given EPL seasons and how did they progress eventually with
every season. 

We are also focused on determining which are the teams which were eliminated in a
given EPL season and which were promoted to EPL from Division 1 for the next season. In the end,
we also want to determine which was the most dominant EPL team in the given tenure.
